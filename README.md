# BharatIntern
This is my first intership project that I have done in web development for Bharat Intern. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the whole process. Kindly go through my work and get back to me with your feedback.
Constructive criticism is always welcome.
There are three tasks in th given internship which are mentioned as follows.
1. Netflix clone
2. Temperature converter
3. Portfolio website  for myself

In all the three tasks I personally like the portfolio website that I have made for myself.
